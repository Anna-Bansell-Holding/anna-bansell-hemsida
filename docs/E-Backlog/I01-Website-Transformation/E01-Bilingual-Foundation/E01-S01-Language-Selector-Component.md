  currentLanguage: 'se' | 'en';
  onLanguageChange: (language: 'se' | 'en') => void;
  className?: string;
}

const LanguageSelector: React.FC<LanguageSelectorProps> = ({
  currentLanguage,
  onLanguageChange,
  className
}) => {
  return (
    <div className={cn("language-selector", className)}>
      <button
        onClick={() => onLanguageChange('se')}
        className={cn("lang-button", currentLanguage === 'se' && "active")}
        aria-pressed={currentLanguage === 'se'}
      >
        SE
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() => onLanguageChange('en')}
        className={cn("lang-button", currentLanguage === 'en' && "active")}
        aria-pressed={currentLanguage === 'en'}
      >
        EN
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface LanguageContextType {
  currentLanguage: 'se' | 'en';
  setLanguage: (language: 'se' | 'en') => void;
}

const LanguageContext = createContext<LanguageContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const LanguageProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentLanguage, setCurrentLanguage] = useState<'se' | 'en'>('se');

  const setLanguage = useCallback((language: 'se' | 'en') => {
    setCurrentLanguage(language);
    localStorage.setItem('preferredLanguage', language);
    // Update URL parameter for shareability
    const url = new URL(window.location.href);
    url.searchParams.set('lang', language);
    window.history.replaceState({}, '', url.toString());
  }, []);

  return (
    <LanguageContext.Provider value={{ currentLanguage, setLanguage }}>
      {children}
    </LanguageContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

- **Button descriptions**: Descriptive text for each language option

## Design Specifications

### Visual Design
```css
.language-selector {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.375rem;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}

.lang-button {
  padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  background: transparent;
  color: #64748b;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.lang-button:hover {
  background: rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1);
  color: #3b82f6;
}

.lang-button.active {
  background: #3b82f6;
  color: white;
  border-color: #3b82f6;
}

.lang-button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #3b82f6;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### Mobile Responsive Design
- Touch-friendly button sizing (minimum 44px target area)
- Appropriate spacing for mobile interaction
- Clear visual hierarchy on smaller screens
- Professional appearance across all device sizes

## Analytics and Tracking

### Usage Metrics
- Language selection frequency
- User session language preferences  
- Geographic correlation with language choice
- Time spent in each language
- Conversion rates by language preference

### Implementation
```typescript
const trackLanguageChange = (language: 'se' | 'en') => {
  // Analytics tracking implementation
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'language_change', {
      language: language,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
};
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL DESIGN MISUNDERSTANDING IDENTIFIED: Language Selection Implementation Approach

**Problem**: Language selector implemented as separate component instead of integrated navigation menu item
**Sketch Reference**: StartPage Desktop Concept shows language selection as a MENU ITEM within navigation, not separate component
**Design Intent**: Language selection should be one of the navigation menu items with globe icon, with contact having phone icon
**Implementation Gap**: Current approach uses separate LanguageSelector component positioned next to menu
**Storage Approach**: Should use session cookies for language preference, not URL parameters
**WPS2C Lesson**: Sketch consultation requires detailed interaction pattern analysis, not just spatial positioning understanding

### Corrective Action Required
- [x] **Redesign language selection as navigation menu item with globe icon**
- [x] **Add phone icon to contact menu item**
- [x] **Implement session cookie storage instead of URL parameters**
- [x] **Ensure browser language detection works with session storage**
- [x] **Remove separate LanguageSelector component and integrate into menu structure**
- [x] **Update menu item interaction patterns for language switching**
- [x] **Implement light gray hover effect for better visual feedback**
- [x] **Stabilize menu width to prevent cursor misalignment during language changes**
- [x] **Improve hover cursor tracking for accurate menu item following**
- [x] **Add dynamic cursor position recalculation when menu layout changes**
- [x] **Implement smooth language transition animation to prevent content jumping**
- [x] **Add delayed hover cursor fade-out after language click for better visual continuity**
- [x] **Display full language names Svenska/English instead of SE/EN initials for better clarity**
- [x] **Improve visual separation between selected state and hover state for better distinction**
- [x] **Increase spacing between menu items for better visual separation and easier targeting**
- [x] **Optimize menu item separation spacing for proper visual balance**

### Acceptance Testing Required
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Verify language selector integrated within navigation header per sketch
- [ ] Client needs to test SE/EN language switching functionality
- [ ] Verify navigation menu bilingual labels work correctly
- [ ] Confirm session persistence across page refreshes
- [ ] Test URL parameter sharing functionality
