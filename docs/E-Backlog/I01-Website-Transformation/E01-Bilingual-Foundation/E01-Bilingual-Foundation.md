## Epic Development Record

### E01-S01-Language-Selector-Component Status
**Story Status**: Task Performed - Awaiting Client Acceptance Testing ‚úÖ

**Work Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Language selector component implemented with SE/EN toggle functionality
- ‚úÖ LanguageContext for global state management with persistence
- ‚úÖ Navigation integration with bilingual menu labels
- ‚úÖ Full accessibility compliance and mobile responsive design
- ‚úÖ URL parameter support and session persistence

**Critical Learning - Sketch Consultation Required**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Divergence**: Language selector was initially placed separately from navigation header instead of integrated within navigation header object as specified in StartPage Desktop Concept sketch
- üìù **WPS2C Methodology Lesson**: Visual design intent cannot be conveyed through written specifications alone - sketch consultation is mandatory before UI development
- üéØ **Corrective Action Required**: Language selector needs repositioning to integrate within navigation header object as per sketch specifications

### Critical Corrective Action Required
**Issue**: Language selector positioned separately from navigation header instead of integrated within navigation header object
**Sketch Reference**: StartPage Desktop Concept shows language selector as part of unified navigation header  
**Required Fix**: Reposition language selector to integrate within navigation header component per sketch specifications
**Impact**: Visual design alignment and professional presentation consistency

### Next Development
**Current Story**: E01-S02-Bilingual-Content-Infrastructure ‚è≥
**Prerequisite**: Complete S01 sketch-compliant repositioning before proceeding
