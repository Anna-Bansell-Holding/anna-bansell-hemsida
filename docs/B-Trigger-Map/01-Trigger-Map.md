## Introduction to Trigger Map Methodology

A **Trigger Map** is a strategic visualization tool that maps the relationship between business goals, target user groups, and their usage motivations. This methodology follows the WPS2C approach where business visions drive system design to serve specific personas while addressing their positive goals and avoiding their fears.

The trigger map uses a **left-to-right flow**: Business Goals → Project System → Target User Groups & Usage Goals. This creates a clear line of sight from strategic objectives through system positioning to user value delivery.
