# Trigger Map - Bansell.se

## Introduction to Trigger Map Methodology

A **Trigger Map** is a strategic visualization tool that maps the relationship between business goals, target user groups, and their usage motivations. This methodology follows a user-centered approach where business visions drive system design to serve specific personas while addressing their positive goals and avoiding their fears.

The trigger map uses a **left-to-right flow**: Business Goals ‚Üí Project System ‚Üí Target User Groups & Usage Goals. This creates a clear line of sight from strategic objectives through system positioning to user value delivery.
