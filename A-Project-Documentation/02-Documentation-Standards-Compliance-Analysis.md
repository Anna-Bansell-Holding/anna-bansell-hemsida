### Technical Documentation Compliance Gaps

**Implementation Feasibility Analysis Missing**:
- No features categorized by feasibility level (High/Medium/Low)
- Missing pre-AI velocity estimates in man-weeks
- No BMad acceleration factors or percentage improvements
- Required competencies not documented
- Technical requirements not listed with clear dependencies
- BMad effectiveness factors not specified
- Implementation steps lack detailed breakdown with time estimates
- Risk assessment absent for all features

**Enterprise Readiness Validation Absent**:
- Business alignment section incomplete
- Product management handoff requirements missing
- Stakeholder communication framework not defined
- Compliance and security requirements not addressed
- Quality assurance criteria not established

### Professional Language Standard Violations

**Casual Language Examples**:
```markdown
❌ Casual: "This is a perfect project to evaluate..."
✅ Professional: "This project serves as a comprehensive evaluation of..."

❌ Casual: "Pretty straightforward implementation"
✅ Professional: "Implementation has low complexity"

❌ Casual: "Should probably add some features"
✅ Professional: "Feature enhancement is recommended"
```

**Technical Ambiguity Issues**:
```markdown
❌ Vague: "Good performance is required"
✅ Specific: "Response times under 200ms for 95th percentile"

❌ Vague: "Professional presentation"
✅ Specific: "Enterprise-grade presentation meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
```

### File Structure and Organization Violations

**Naming Convention Issues**:
- Current: `1.1-StartPage.md`
- Required: `1.1-StartPage_Synopsis.md`

**Missing Required Sections**:
- Implementation Feasibility Analysis
- Technical Specifications Depth
- Enterprise Readiness Validation
- Success Metrics Framework
- Quality Assurance Validation

**Cross-Reference Management**:
- Component reference links pointing to non-existent files
