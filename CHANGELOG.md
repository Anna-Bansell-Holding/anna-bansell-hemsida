Files: [1.1-StartPage.md](docs/C-Scenarios/01-Browse-Website/1.1-StartPage/1.1-StartPage.md) (major content update with translations)
Rationale: Specification must reflect actual implemented code content and provide proper bilingual support for Swedish primary market with English accessibility
Next Actions: Use updated specification as reference for content refinement and future feature development

### 2025-09-02 11:35: [STRUCTURE] - Removed "Synopsis" from scenario page filenames for cleaner professional naming
Impact: Low - Improves file naming consistency and removes unnecessary terminology from documentation structure
